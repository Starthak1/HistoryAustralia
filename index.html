                <h4 style="text-align: left; color: gray;">Before the British's arrival into Australia, the indigenous people of Australia were the only people that lived in Australia. All these poeple however, are of different nations and they have their own language/dialect, beliefs, laws, and tradition etc. More than 50000 years before the arrival of the British, the Aboriginal and Torred Strait Islander people had lived their lives as hunters and gatherers. It was because of the lack of any signs of ownership over the land, such as fences, farm animals, buildings or crops that the British thought that Australia was free of any human life to contest them in claiming Australia for their own.</h4>

                  <h4 style="text-align: left; color: gray;">The British began their colonisation of Australia with the "First Fleet" in 1788. For the first few years of the invasion the British decided to settle around the Sydney area. More settlements designed for convicts were founded in Tasmania beginning in 1803. The area which is now known as Brsibane became another convict settlement in 1824. Southern Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania were made seperate settlements in the early 1830s. however they were all ruled with a more direct government in the 1840s having a system with a governor and an appointed council.</h4>

                  <h4 style="text-align: left; color: gray;">In Australia the Aboriginals resistance against the British was swift. A remarkable man named Pemulwuy had led counter raids against the British settlers and they even ambushed exploration and foraging parties between 1790 and 1802. Deespite these efforts the British seemed to have had very little understanding for why the indigenous people fought back against them so hard.</h4>

                  <br>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left; color: gray;">It was on the 1st of January 1901 that Australia became an independent nation when the British Parliament passed a legislation allowing the six Australian colonies to govern together within the right of their own known as the Commonwealth of Australia. Initially, it was a slow switch starting in 1870 where the last of the British soldiers left and then there were several acts that took place even after 1901 such as the Statue of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 and so on and so fourth.</h4>

                  <h4 style="text-align: left; color: gray;">The British's colonisation over Australia has caused terrible problems in their society such as inequity, racism and disruption of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. Unfortunately it has perhaps been one of the most detrimental problems Australia has faced in terms of health which still to this day influences the Aboriginlas and Torres Strait ISlander's health outcomes even today.</h4>
